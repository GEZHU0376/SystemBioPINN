# SystemBioPINN
Using system biology informed neural networks to infer hidden dynamics of coagulation

## Numerical simulation
1) Based on two models (Anand and Zarnisina model)

## Network training
1) Training data are the numerical simulation results

## Performance
1) We manipulated different depth of the NN to evaluate performance
2) Nonlinear parametric analysis was performed using the system biology informed NN
